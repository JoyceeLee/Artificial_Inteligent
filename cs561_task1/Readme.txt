Tasks:
1) Find a path between two specific nodes with Breadth-first search in Graph-Search version 
2) Find a path between two specific nodes with Depth-first search in Graph-Search version
3) Find the optimal path between two specific nodes with Uniform-cost search in Graph-Search version. The optimal path is the path that has minimal delivery time end to end.
4) Find communities (connected components) using breadth-first search or depth-first search. Specify in the readme.txt which algorithm that you use.
